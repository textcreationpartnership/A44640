#A warning from the Lord unto the rulers of Dover And so to all men which stand guilty of the like practises, that all may know a day of repentance before it be too late; for the night will come when as no man can work, in which the son of man will come as a thief unto all such the workers of iniquity, and give to every man according to his deeds done in their body in their life-time. Then wo to the eveil-doer, for it will go ill with him. Also, the Christian man's plea for his liberty, as he is so indeed and in truth: and also, as he is a free-born English-man, he lays claim to his birth-right, by way of expostulation with the rulers of Dover, who rob him and many others of it, refusing to shew us any order for their so doing. Together with a true testimony born to the Light of Jesus, the power of God, yea the power of the endless life, from everlasting to everlasting: by Luke Howard.#
